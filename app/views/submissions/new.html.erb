          It is our pleasure to invite you to the Fourth Annual Physics and Astronomy Symposium. The conference is organized by the PHAS Departmental Graduate Association and will take place at <strong>SB142 and SA109</strong> on the main campus of the University of Calgary on <strong>February 20, 2019</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
           The purpose of the PHAS Symposium is to bring together researchers from all PHAS groups to share their ongoing research. All PHAS graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral research fellows are welcome and encouraged to submit an abstract for an oral and/or a poster presentation. There is a $5 registration fee for both attendees and presenters. Lunch and coffee/refreshments will be provided, and there will be a social event in the evening at the Last Defence Lounge. Prizes will be given out for best talks and posters! Details of this and other DGA events are also available on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UCalgary-PHAS-DGA-1528636897397050/">Facebook page</a>.
        </p>

	<p>
	We are pleased to announce two invited speakers for the Symposium: 
	<p>
<%= image_tag('jorn-head-2.png', height: '100', style: 'float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px') %> <strong>Dr J&ouml;rn Davidsen</strong>, Humboldt Research Fellow from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Calgary</li>
	</p>
	<p>
	 J&ouml;rn Davidsen is a tenured associate professor with the Department of Physics and Astronomy here at the university. His current research focus is on physics of complex systems. Using applications of statistical and computational physics and modern network theory, he tackles a variety of problems, such as extreme events, seismicity and climate dynamics. Additionally, on the biology/chemistry front, he investigates defect-mediated turbulence, cardiac arrhythmia and neuronal firing patterns.
	</p>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Physical, geophysical, chemical, living and man-made systems often show behaviors that cannot be understood by studying their building blocks or constituents to ever finer detail but that are emergent. The concept of emergence can be summarized by the statement that there exists an entity (e.g. an organism) which is more than the sum of its parts. Systems showing emergence are typically considered complex. Prominent examples of complex systems include the brain and interacting populations of earthquake faults, with immense importance for society: Recent catastrophic earthquakes in Japan, Haiti, Italy and Indonesia and ever-increasing population density in large metropolitan areas near major active faults (e.g., Mexico City, Istanbul, San Francisco bay area) highlight the great societal importance of predicting and forecasting naturally occurring earthquakes. This is also true for earthquakes unintendedly induced by geoengineering activities, such as hydraulic fracturing — a key enabling technology for unconventional resource development in the oil and gas industry. Another example is the brain. Understanding the relationship between structure, dynamics and function in the brain is a crucial step towards innovative solutions for brain-related diseases such as epilepsy and the goal of large-scale research projects such as the CAD $1.6 billion Human Brain Project. In this talk, I will focus on the broad theme of triggering processes and information cascades as one specific approach to model complex systems.

	</p>
	<p>
    Dr. Greg Pierce has been a Radiation Oncology Medical Physicist at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre since 2013. He previously completed his Medical Physicist Residency in London, Ontario at the London Regional Cancer Program. His current research interests and work are the delivery of Total Body Irradiation for Bone Marrow Transplant.

    <p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Radiation oncology medical physicists are responsible for many aspects of a cancer patient’s treatment, from the initial diagnosis to the final treatment and cure.  An example of the unique work they perform comes during the development, commissioning and implementation of a new technique to replace and old technique.  In this talk, the process of changing from an old total body irradiation (TBI) technique to a new advanced TBI technique is presented.  The involvement of the Medical Physicist is highlighted throughout the project.
